Python 3. The suggested installation method is via [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation) or
[asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html).

### Setup

1. Create a virtual environment:
    ```shell
    python -m venv ./venv
   ```
2. Install all requirements, **including dev requirements**:
    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```
3. Install pre-commit:
    ```shell
    pre-commit install
   ```

## <a name="deployment"></a>Deployment
The AWS infrastructure (Lambda resources) is built on Travis CI.
The deployment cycle takes the following steps:
* Travis CI builds and creates ZIP archive
* Travis CI pushes ZIP archive to S3 bucket
* Travis CI runs CloudFormation template `/arch/lambda.yaml` for creating/updating Lambda function
* Travis CI updates Lambda function via created ZIP archive

Variables should be set before deployment and should be deleted after successful deploy.
